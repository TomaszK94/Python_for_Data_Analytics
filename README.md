    - `Pandas:` Used to process and analyze the dataset.
    - `Matplotlib:` Employed for generating visual representations of the data.
    - `Seaborn:` Allowed for the creation of more sophisticated and detailed visualizations.

- `Jupyter Notebooks:` The platform I used to execute my Python scripts, which provided a convenient way to incorporate notes and observations alongside the code.

- `Visual Studio Code:` My preferred editor for running Python scripts.

- `Git & GitHub:` Crucial for version control, enabling me to share my Python scripts and analyses, facilitating collaboration and keeping track of the projectâ€™s progress.

# Data Preparatin and Cleanup 

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data 

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```Python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```

# The Analysis 

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills i should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

## Highest Paid and Most Demanded Skills for Data

Next, I refined my analysis to concentrate exclusively on data analyst positions. I examined both the highest-paying and most sought-after skills, and presented these findings using two bar charts.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

sns.set_theme(style="ticks")
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x="median", y=df_DA_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue="median", palette="dark:b_r", legend=False)

ax[0].set_title("Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts")
ax[0].set_ylabel("")
ax[0].set_xlabel("")
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f"${int(x/1000)}K"))

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x="median", y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue="median", palette="light:b", legend=False)

ax[1].set_title("Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts")
ax[1].set_ylabel("")
ax[1].set_xlabel("Median Salary (USD)")
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f"${int(x/1000)}K"))

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Results
![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US](03_Project/Images/top_paid.png)

*Two separate Horizontal bar charts visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US*

### Insights

#### `Top 10 Highest Paid Skills` for `Data Analysts` (Top Chart)
This chart shows the `highest-paid skills` for data analysts, but the number of job opportunities requiring these skills is relatively low, which drives up the salaries for those few roles.

`Dplyr` ($200K) is highly specialized and used mainly in R programming for data manipulation. Despite high pay, jobs requiring this skill are rare.

`Bitbucket` and `GitLab` (around $190K) are used for version control. These tools are essential in certain environments, but demand for data analysts needing them is limited.

`Solidity` ($185K) is a blockchain-specific language. Its application is niche, explaining the small number of high-paying roles.

`Hugging Face` ($175K) is focused on NLP and machine learning, with few roles needing this advanced skill.

`Couchbase` and `Cassandra` (above $150K) are NoSQL databases used in large-scale systems, with fewer data analyst roles requiring this expertise.

`Ansible` ($160K) is an automation tool important in infrastructure roles, but there are few job openings for analysts needing this skill.

`Mxnet` and `VMware` ($150K) are used in specialized machine learning and cloud-related roles, leading to higher pay but fewer positions.

The common theme across these high-paying skills is that the number of job openings that require them is relatively low compared to more widely-used skills. This doesnâ€™t imply that the skills are not valuable, but rather that their application is specialized and thus leads to fewer job postings. In these niche markets, when companies do need a specialist, they are willing to pay significantly more because the supply of qualified professionals is smaller, creating a high-salary environment despite the low overall job demand.

#### `Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills` for `Data Analysts` (Bottom Chart)
The bottom chart focuses on widely used, `in-demand skills` for data analysts, which, while offering lower salaries than niche skills, are essential across many industries.

`Python` ($100K) is the most in-demand programming language for data analysis and is widely used across industries.

`Tableau` ($100K) is highly valued for data visualization and reporting in many businesses.

`R` ($95K) is popular in statistical analysis, especially in research and academia.

`SQL Server` and `SQL` (around $90K) are foundational database skills used in nearly every data analyst role.

`SAS`, `Power BI`, and `Excel` ($85K-$90K) are commonly used for reporting and analytics, making them highly demanded.

`PowerPoint` and `Word` ($80K) are general tools for communication and reporting, with widespread demand but lower pay.

#### Conclusion:
The top chart highlights that the highest-paying skills have fewer job openings, making them highly lucrative but less commonly needed. In contrast, the bottom chart shows that foundational skills like Python, SQL, and Tableau are in high demand across many industries, offering more job opportunities but at slightly lower pay due to the wider talent pool.

## 4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn (the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.
